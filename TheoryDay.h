Day 01 theory:

Fake it until you make it!

- Ancestors

  plant mooves in function of where the player is (point in the middle of the plant, that goes to the middle of the player)
  Hitbox player / hitbox plant --> simple tranformation, detect collision --> get distance between center --> transformation on the model

  monkey slides down... how unexpected. Justify the kinetic enegy (bounce or slide, or break)
  jump --> aply a function that slides you down --> What is the input?  Horizontal(not accurrate, doesn't adapt to the situation) 
  Velocity? more precise, Vy Vx for bouncing and Vz distance slide

- ABZÛ

  plants --> move away
  a compound object with joints, rotate the nodes in collision with the player and the lines still constant
  The camera collides as well

- Euclidian / Non Euclidian

  Euclidian / Eliptical / Hiperbolic
